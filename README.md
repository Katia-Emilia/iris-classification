# Iris Flower Classification

This Jupyter notebook contains code for performing classification on the Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVC), and Naive Bayes. The model is evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy score on the test set.

### DATA SET
The dataset used in this notebook is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers. There are four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and one target variable (species).
